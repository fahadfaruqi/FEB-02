            <h3>Little description about myself regarding the technologies i worked upon through out my Engineering! </h3> 
            
            <p> My name is Fahad Faruqi. I have done my Bachelor's of Engineering in the department of Electronics and Communication Engineering.So basically through out my Engineering, I have a hands on experience on programming languages like "Java","C++","Embedded C" and on machine languages including "8085","8086","ARM processor","Intel","Embedded Systems" and "Image Processing". My Final Year Project was on IoT(Internet of Things) based hardware device which runs in the form of hardware-software duality and the programming language which was embedded on that device was "Embedded C". So you guys might be thinking about How can an ECE guy is more inclined towards software industry? Well, I was more inclined towards software more than hardware before I started my journey in Engineering. And right now after the completion of my graduation, I am a Software Development Engineer/Full Stack Developer currently working in an IT Company currently based in Surat. I have worked upon various projects including websites and mobile web applications and currently serving my profession as an Jr.SDE(Software Development Engineer). </p>
